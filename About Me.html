				<h2><b>Hello World</b></h2>
				<p> <br>I would like to welcome everyone to my blog. I like to travel and meet new people. I also love trying new food and listening to new music. I will use this space to add into my findings.
</br>
<br>And you ... why do you travel?</br>
<br>All this has given me a lot to think about, reflecting on the reasons why I travel.</br>
<br>
And probably the headline would come here given by the name of our blog, Traveler Learning. I travel mostly to learn, to surprise me.
</br>
<br>
To be able to understand what is beyond the imaginary line that we invent humans and call border. To be able to see closely the stories and adventures that I always read in novels or with which I enjoyed in the cinema.
</br>
