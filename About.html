				<h2>How long can you go around the world?</h2>
				<p>
Ok, this is something personal. I understand that in nine months you can travel through Spain (much of it) and learn Spanish.
</br>
<br>

I understand that nine months is enough to understand many cultures that can be shared within a continent. Several related countries that share several characteristics where you can really soak up things and get a general idea.
</br>
<br>
I understand that you can see Southeast Asia in nine months, that you can travel across much of South America at that time.
</br>
<br>
But the world is too big.
</br>
<br>
An entrepreneur of a multinational has gone around the world infinitely.
</br>
<br>
Does it mean that you have "traveled"?
</br>
<br>
Maybe, maybe.
</br>
<br> Our time is short. Let's enjoy it.</br></p>
