				<h2><b>Why shouldn't you feed wild animals on your trips?</b></h2>
<img src="/Users/carolinabarragan/Downloads/html5-page-layout/image11.jpg"width="600">
				<p>The availability of food is one of the biggest conditions for wild animal populations and their behavior. When the human being feeds the wildlife, it usually causes these animals to spend less time looking for food and their territory decreases, in addition to benefiting those more aggressive species and individuals, which tend to monopolize these foods.

			<p>It has also been seen that it can modify the migratory capacity of certain species, or even increase their reproduction. These changes do not seem of great importance although they have a clear impact on nature, but the big problem comes when these animals become accustomed and depend on both the human being and the food it provides.

Finding nutritious foods in nature is quite complicated, so when we offer our succulent food to these animals, they do not hesitate to feed on them. In addition, the more we feed them, the less food they seek on their own and end up relying heavily on man.</p>

Many animals, the search for food is something they learn from their parents, so if we feed the wild animals on many occasions we prevent them from learning to find their own food and further reinforce this dependence.

The problem for nature becomes even more serious when we feed invasive species that damage our ecosystems. Raccoons and parrots in some cities in Spain are an example of this, since they are fed by people, assuming a risk to both our health and the environment.
