				<p>Talking about malaria at a medical or scientific level is not the claim of this post because we are neither doctors nor do we dedicate ourselves to it at a scientific level. We do not want to go into details on a subject as serious as malaria, we simply want to offer you the maximum information that you can find on the web so that it helps you to better understand the disease, how to prevent it, its symptoms, etc.

			<h2><b>What is malaria (or malaria)?</b></h2>
<p>malaria is a life-threatening disease common in many tropical and subtropical regions. It is currently endemic in more than 100 countries that are visited annually by more than 125 million international travelers.

Every year there are many international travelers who contract malaria in countries where this disease is endemic, with more than 10,000 who fall ill after returning. Due to underreporting, the actual figures may exceed 30,000. International travelers have a high risk of contracting malaria because they are not immune and often face a diagnosis of late or wrong malaria upon returning home. The appearance of fever in a traveler within two to three months after leaving an endemic area constitutes a medical emergency and should be urgently investigated.</p>

<h2><b>Cause of malaria</b></h2>

<h2><b>Spread of malaria</h2></b>
<p>The malaria parasite is transmitted by several species of Anopheles mosquito, which bites mainly between dusk and dawn, hence it is recommended to use mosquito repellent.</p>
