				<h2><b>What is up with Visas?</b></h2>

				<p>Yes, you read correctly: today we are going to talk about what a visa (or visa) is, what it is for and the different types that exist, while answering the typical questions that come to the web, which are repeated and denote that not everyone is as familiar with this topic as we imagined
</article>

			<h2><b>What is a visa (or visa)?</b></h2>
<p>Getting to the point and without much prose: a visa is a permit offered by a country other than yours so you can stay in it for a certain time. Such a visa is usually a piece of paper that is pasted on a sheet of your passport that proves that the authorities have granted you such permission.</p>
</article>

<h2>Do I always need a visa?</h2>
<p>Every citizen who wants to enter another country will need a second permission to do so. In some cases it will be in the form of a visa and in other cases in the form of a visa exemption. Apart from the above, there are agreements between countries of the same continent, such as in Europe, where there is the free movement of citizens through countries of the Schengen Area.</p>
