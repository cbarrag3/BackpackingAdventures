				<h2><b>What clothes to take to a trip in South Asia?</b></h2>
				<p> Are you organizing your first backpacking trip through Southeast Asia and you don't know what clothes to put in your backpack? Well, let's try to help you. During all these years jumping around this area of the world we have had enough time to know its weather and after having made some mistakes (like going to Sapa in December with summer clothes and almost freezing to death on the motorcycle), we have learned to choose well the clothes we will wear. In addition, every time a friend came to visit us he asked us the same thing, what do I put in my backpack? Here is our answer, with the special collaboration of backpackers who have shared a trip with us on occasion.

I will try to explain why my photographic equipment based on my personal experience after years of traveling and everything that has passed through my hands. Let's go there.

<h2><b>Pants</b></h2>
<br>Surely the first thing you think when you are preparing the backpack to visit this part of the world is in its high temperatures. Yes, in Southeast Asia it is hot, so catch a pair of shorts for beach days, for motorcycle excursions, for days when it is 30 degrees in the shade ...</br>

<br>
I also recommend long pants for the nights in places where there are many mosquitoes, especially if it bothers you to always be repellent, it will protect you from their pecks (less than those of Koh Tao, which go through any type of fabric). In my case I like to wear some joggers or alibaba style, which are usually very cool, you can climb them up to the knee and use them both day and night and so you have a two in one. The leggins occupy the same as some fat socks in the backpack. You will also need long pants if you go to northern Thailand, Laos or Vietnam in the cooler months, which are usually from November to February.</br><br>And if you plan to do some trekking, do not forget to put on appropriate hiking pants or something comfortable for sports such as, again, tights.</br></p>

			<h2><b>Shirts</b></h2>
<br> Short sleeve or braces. The first for when you need to protect yourself a little from the sun, to enter temples, to go by motorcycle or bicycle and not to burn your back and shoulders and the second for beach places or very hot days.

I also recommend not to forget a long-sleeved T-shirt for places where it cools *, stays at airports, nights by bus or train, for when you are on a terrace in the afternoon and mosquitoes get heavy ... If you are not going to places where it is cold *, it is not necessary to carry anything more warm because it will be a bulge in the backpack that you will not use.</br>

			<h2><b>Shoes</b></h2>
<p>For years our footwear in the backpacks was limited to wearing flip flops and mountain shoes for when we had to do hiking or trekking routes of several days. With the flip flops we went everywhere, but it is true that we made "very rural" trips in which we never felt too much "pull", and also, in most places you have to take off your shoes to enter.</p>
