				<h2><b>What is the ideal photographic equipment and equipment to go on a trip?</b></h2>
				<p> Along with the backpack, the camera has always been another important item for the traveler, at least before the smartphone, you can now have a beastly quality in a small design that allows you to put it in any pocket. I hope this text entertains you or helps you a little with your doubts.

I will try to explain why my photographic equipment based on my personal experience after years of traveling and everything that has passed through my hands. Let's go there.

<h2><b>The camera, your soul friend</b></h2>
What camera did I buy? And what objective? I have had many friends and acquaintances who, when they started to like photography or before starting a trip, asked me these questions and always answered the same thing: what kind of photography do you want to take? Because depending on the type of photos you are going to take, it will be convenient to have a camera or another or according to what objective.

From my personal experience, I believe that, today, mirrorless cameras are the most suitable for traveling with them. They offer an unquestionable quality, are of smaller size (and weight) than the reflexes and, precisely because of their system without mirrors, the objectives that make the brands are physically smaller to the same characteristics as the same models for the reflexes. And when we talk about being one, two or four months carrying equipment ... you have to see what it shows on a day-to-day basis.</p>

				<h2><b>Photo storage, which one is better?</b></h2>
<img src="/Users/carolinabarragan/Downloads/html5-page-layout/image2.jpg"width="600">
				<p>How many photos do you plan to take? 100, 500, 3000? It depends on the camera you carry and the resolution you have (the more megapixels the larger the file size), if you shoot in JPG or RAW, or if you record video with your camera, the time will come when your data card , however large it may be, it will end up running out of space. What to do then? Well, let's do it with this couple of interesting options that I am going to show you and an extra option that I strongly advise you to keep in mind.

<ul>
  <li>Hard Drives with Card Reader</li>
  <li>External Hard Drive</li>
  <li>Amazon Drive</li>
  <li>Google Photos</li>
<br>
Finally! You can also make your own blog and save your photos there.
